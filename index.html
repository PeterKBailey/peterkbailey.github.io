            <p>
                Hi I'm Peter. Welcome to my portfolio website! I Graduated from Carleton University's co-operative education Computer Science Honours program with high distinction in June 2024. I received the <a href="https://newsroom.carleton.ca/story/carleton-honours-2024-spring-convocation-medallists/#3">Governor General's medal</a> - awarded annually to the student standing at the head of the graduating class at the undergraduate level. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now pursuing a career in software development and engineering.
